# Lab 2: Principles of Programming Languages

## Overview
Lab 2 deepens your understanding of functions in Python, explores the built-in `math` library, and introduces advanced string formatting techniques. This lab emphasizes practical applications of Python functions to solve mathematical problems and manipulate strings effectively.

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Triangle Area Calculation
Write a function `tri_surf` that calculates the area of a right-angled triangle using the lengths of its sides. Ensure the inputs are valid.

### Exercise 2: Absolute Value Function
Implement a function `absolute` that takes a real number as input and returns its absolute value without using the built-in `abs` function.

### Exercise 3: Maximum of Three Numbers
Create a function that takes three numbers as arguments and prints the product of the two larger numbers.

### Exercise 4: Square Root Calculation
Develop a function `mySqrt1` that calculates the square root of a number using Newton's method. Compare your function's output with Python's built-in `math.sqrt` for validation.

#### Additional Tasks for Exercise 4
- Implement `mySqrt2`, incorporating all necessary helper functions to perform the square root calculation.
- Write `mySqrt3`, which refines the calculation without sending all helper functions each time.

### Exercise 5: Student Grades Calculation
Write a function to compute the average grade of students after applying a square root curve (factor) to their original scores.

## Python String Formatting
Understand the use of Python's `.format()` method and the Formatter class for advanced string manipulations. Learn to use placeholders, format specifications, and access arguments by position or name for more readable and flexible code outputs.

### Key String Formatting Concepts:
- Placeholder syntax and nested replacement fields
- Formatting options for alignment, width, precision, and type
- Usage of format specifications and mini-language for custom formatting behaviors

## Python `math` Library
Familiarize yourself with Python's `math` library, which provides access to mathematical functions and constants. This library is essential for performing complex mathematical operations beyond basic arithmetic.

## Installation and Setup
Ensure you have Python and PyCharm installed. Follow the Lab 1 setup instructions if you haven't set up your environment yet.
