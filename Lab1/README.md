# Lab 1: Principles of Programming Languages

## Course Overview
This lab is part of the "Principles of Programming Languages" course, focusing on the basics of Python programming and key concepts in software development.

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion
Create a Python program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and displays the temperature. The formula for conversion is: `tempC = (5.0 / 9.0) * (tempF - 32.0)`.

### Exercise 2: Factorial Calculation
Write a Python algorithm to calculate the factorial of numbers from 0 to 19, using a `for` loop. The algorithm starts with `f = 1` and `n = 0`, and for each iteration, it outputs `n`, `"! = "`, and `f`, then increments `n` and updates `f` by multiplying it by `n`.

### Exercise 3: Number Squares and Cubes Table
Using a `for` loop, create a segment of code that prints a table of numbers from 0 to 9, their squares, and their cubes.

### Exercise 4: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
Implement a Python program using Euclid's algorithm to compute the GCD of two integers. The algorithm repeatedly replaces the larger number with its difference with the smaller number until one of the numbers reaches zero.

## Installation Instructions

### Python
1. Visit [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download Python 3.7.0 for your Windows version.
2. During installation, ensure to check "Add Python 3.7 to PATH".
3. After installation, verify by opening a command prompt and typing `python --version`.

### PyCharm (IDE)
1. Download the Community version of PyCharm from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
2. Follow the installation wizard steps to install PyCharm.
3. On first launch, select "Don’t Send" for data sharing, customize your environment if desired, and ensure the Python interpreter is set up correctly.

## First Python Program
Create a new project in PyCharm, and within this project, create a new Python file named `hello_world.py`. Type in `print(‘Hello, World !’)` and run the program to ensure your setup is correctly configured.

## Important Notes
- **Indentation:** Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Use 4 spaces per indentation level for consistency.
- **If Statements and Loops:** Familiarize yourself with the syntax for `if` statements, `for`, and `while` loops as these constructs will be used in the lab exercises.
