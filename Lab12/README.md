# Lab 12: Recursive Data Structures, Memoization, and Exception Handling in Python

## Overview
Lab 12 delves into the intricacies of recursive data structures, the efficiency-enhancing technique of memoization, and the critical aspect of exception handling in Python. Through a series of exercises, you'll explore how to implement and manipulate recursive data structures, improve the performance of recursive functions using memoization, and ensure your programs can gracefully handle unexpected errors or conditions.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement recursive functions for data manipulation and sorting algorithms.
- Learn to use memoization for optimizing recursive function calls to enhance performance.
- Explore exception handling in Python to manage errors and unexpected conditions robustly.

## Exercises Overview and Solutions

### 1. Recursive Merge Function
- Implemented a recursive function `Merge` that takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list. This exercise demonstrates the use of recursion for data manipulation and combines elements from different data structures efficiently.

### 2. Mergesort Algorithm
- Applied the Mergesort algorithm, a classic example of divide and conquer strategy using recursion. The exercise involves splitting a list into halves, recursively sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together.

### 3. Recursive Tree Operations
- Explored binary trees by implementing functions to perform an in-order traversal (`print_tree`) and a mirror reflection of the tree structure (`mirror`). These functions illustrate the application of recursion in tree data structures for both data access and modification.

### 4. Thief's Backpack Problem
- Solved a combinatorial problem using a recursive function `isAnyOptionToSteal` to determine if a thief can fill their backpack with items of specific weights to reach an exact weight limit. This problem showcases the power of recursion in exploring potential combinations of data.

### 5. Memoization Technique
- Enhanced the performance of a recursive function by applying memoization, a technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This optimization significantly improves the efficiency of recursive algorithms.

### 6. Handling Exceptions
- Implemented functions to handle various exceptions, such as division by zero and invalid user input, demonstrating Python's exception handling mechanism. This exercise emphasizes the importance of writing robust programs that can deal with errors gracefully and maintain their integrity in the face of unexpected conditions.

### 7. File Operations and Exception Handling
- Developed functions for reading data from files, calculating average grades, and handling exceptions related to file access and data validity. This exercise combines file operations with exception handling to ensure data integrity and program stability.

## Conclusion
Lab 12 provides a comprehensive exploration of recursive data structures, memoization, and exception handling in Python. Through these exercises, you've acquired valuable skills in writing efficient, robust, and error-resistant programs. These capabilities are essential for developing complex software systems that are both high-performing and reliable.
